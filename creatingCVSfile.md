Here is how to create a csv file with the IAT data, using Excel.

1. Download the data from Qualtrics as csv.

2. Open the csv file with Excel

3. Copy only the cells with BIAT data. For instance, because the BIAT was in Q3 in my Qualtrics questionnaire, the relevant column is under Q3. Select only the cells with that data and copy those cells.

4. Open a notepad (or notepad++ or any other simple editor) and paste the data (the cells you copied) to that file.

5. Replace (usually, using ctrl-H) the text “block,trial with the text block,trial (to remove the “ before block)

6. Replace “”” (three double quotes) with “” (two double quotes)

7. Replace “” (two double quotes) with “ (one double quotes)

8. Save that file as a csv file

9. You can open that csv file to make sure that it is fine.
